    <h1>An Application Permissions Model for honoring User Preferences on Device Capability use</h1>
    <p>VVG &bull; March 4, 2023</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We propose a logical permissions model for use by applications that would honor a user's privacy preferences on
        their device. Our proposal requires developers to change their assumptions about capability demands (eg: request
        webcam, request file i/o) and be prepared to degrade gracefully if the user's preferences deny these capability
        request. We illustrate how the user interaction flow works under this scenario.</p>

    <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
    <p>At the fundamental level, an application is instantiated by the operating system
        as a <b>process</b>. Security is typically tied to the user and most operating
        systems have some form of Role-based permissions system where the user gets a
        set of permissions based on those explicitly assigned to that user and those
        implicitly derived from the roles that the user has been assigned. This model
        does not take into account the fact that the same user may want Application A
        to be granted a certain permission while Application B is denied the same
        permission. For example: a photosharing app is given permission to access the
        camera whereas an RSS newsreader app is denied the permission.
    </p>
    <p>We propose a different organization of the permissions and grants that is centered
        on the user's perspective.</p>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Process</dt>
        <dd>An operating system process that is an instantiation of an executable program.</dd>

        <dt>Capability</dt>
        <dd>A functionality that a process may access in order to do a user task. eg: File I/O, Webcam, Network
            communication etc.,</dd>

        <dt>Capability Profile</dt>
        <dd>A set of capabilities bundled together.</dd>

        <dt>Permission Request</dt>
        <dd>A request by a process for access to a specific capability eg: File I/O.</dd>

        <dt>Permission Grant</dt>
        <dd>A token that signifies the grant of a specific permission.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Default Capability Profiles</h3>
    <p>The default capability profiles are standardized. We define the following standard default capability profiles.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>capability-profile-zero:</b> This is the capability profile that is empty. A process is by default
            assigned this capability profile. It grants no capabilities to the attached process.</li>

        <li><b>capability-profile-service:</b> This is the capability profile that is for a service. No user inputs
            such as touch gestures, keyboard input, webcam etc., are granted. The only capabilities in this profile
            are those typically required for services.</li>

        <li><b>capability-profile-basicuser:</b> This is the basic capability profile that for a user. Basic
            input/output capabilities are available.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Custom Capability Profiles</h3>
    <p>Custom capability profiles are custom groupings of various capabilities bundled together and may be customized by
        a developer or user for deployment on a device.</p>

    <h3>Application Manifest</h3>
    <p>The application is accompanied by a manifest file that declares the set of capabilities that are required by the
        application. The app developer must make no assumptions regarding the grant of permissions to the requested
        capability. For eg: An app may need to be able to take a photograph with the camera on the device. Therefore, it
        may
        list it as a needed capability. However, a user might specify that camera capability has been turned off (for
        example, in their default profile or custom profile). It is the responsibility of the application developer to
        handle these permission denials by the user and fail gracefully.</p>

    <h3>Capability Manager</h3>
    <p>This is a standard UI component that is used for managing the capabilities granted to an application. This user
        interface may be surfaced by any application that uses this permissions model. The capability manager is used
        to attach capability profiles to an application. The capability manager looks at the attached profile and the
        capability profile requested by the application through its manifest and automatically grants the permissions
        granted in the attached profile. The application receives an event notification after the capabilities profile
        has been attached and it can respond to it by updating the UI or notifying the user any other way.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical use</h2>
    <p>In this section we describe the typical use of an application that uses this permissions model.</p>

    <h3>User wants to install an app</h3>
    <p>The user goes to the "Add/Remove programs" control panel. If the control panel application has been granted the
        "Install app" capability, then the user interface will show the interface for Adding/removing programs. If not,
        it will show a message to the user that they don't have the capability to install the application and will show
        the link to the capability manager user interface.</p>
    <p>The user can go to the capability manager and add the capability to "Add/Remove programs" and then proceed to
        install the program.</p>

    <h3>User has installed an app</h3>
    <p>Upon installation, the capability profile requested by the application is compared with the user's default
        capability profile and the capabilities that are allowed are granted. The user is shown a list of requested
        capabilities that have been denied based on the user's capability profle.</p>

    <h3>User runs the app</h3>
    <p>The app makes a call to query the currently attached capability profile and sets up the user interface
        accordingly, enabling only the functionality based on the granted capabilities. Any disabled functionality shows
        the link to the capability manager along with a message that the functionality is disabled due to the user's
        capability profile attached to the process.</p>

    <h3>User grants a new capability/revokes an existing capability to the application&apos;s capability profile</h3>
    <p>When the user uses the capability manager UI to grant a new capability to an application, the application
        receives a notification about change in attached capabilities. It then responds by updating its UI accordingly
        and enabling the functionality. Similarly, when a capability is revoked, the application receives the
        notification and responds accoringly by updating its UI.</p>
